This repository is a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks exploring the fundamental concepts and applications of Computer Vision and Digital Image Processing. From low-level image enhancement and feature extraction to high-level applications like real-time recognition systems, these projects provide hands-on implementations of key algorithms that form the bedrock of modern CV.

This collection covers a wide array of topics, including:

1. Image Enhancement: Improving image quality using Histogram Equalization and Contrast Stretching.
2. Feature Extraction: Analyzing textures with Gabor Filters and identifying significant features with Edge Detection algorithms (like Canny and Sobel).
3. Data Augmentation: Artificially expanding datasets using various Image Augmentation techniques to build more robust models.
4. Core CV Applications: Building practical systems for Live Face Recognition, Object Detection & Recognition, and creating a Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) engine to find visually similar images.
